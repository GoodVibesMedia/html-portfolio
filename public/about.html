<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Vidal and I am an aspiring web developer. My current interest is in
  front end, but will eventually like to go to full-stack.
</p>

<p>
  I'm starting late in this field but I wish to become a strong developer as the
  current tech industry continues to thrive.
</p>

<p>
  Mistakes are made to be shed. It's okay to make them, as long as you learn
  from them.
